EXPLANATION
===========

This program will read in a list of words on stdin, search through your Anki
decks for each word, and automatically add the "HighPriority" tag if the word
is found.  Each word that is not found will be output to stdout.

This program was made to make it easier to automatically use words from
un-studied portions of existing decks, rather than having to input the words
manually (and then having two instances of the word in two different decks).  

This is very useful if, for instance, you are studying the Core10k Japanese 
deck.  When reading a book or getting words from other sources, you can use 
this program to automatically promote the words in the Core10k deck, rather 
than inputting all of the words again in a new deck.

For example, imagine you found the words 犬, 猿, 猫, and アオウミガメ in a 
book.  You want to remember them, but you haven't gotten to them yet in your 
Core10k deck. You can feed this program the file with these four words in it. 
Let's see how this looks on the command line:

$ cat inputfile
犬
猿
猫
アオウミガメ
$

You can see that our input file contains these three words.  Now let's run 
anki-high-priority:

$ anki-high-priority -i inputfile -o outputfile
犬 was found in ['Core10k.anki']
猿 was found in ['Core10k.anki']
猫 was found in ['Core10k.anki']
$

You can see that 犬, 猿, and 猫 were found, so they were automatically given 
the HighPriority tag.  Next time you run Anki, 犬, 猿, and 猫 will be the first 
new cards that appear (as long as you don't have any other cards with the 
HighPriority tag).  Now let's see what the output file looks like

$ cat outputfile
アオウミガメ
$

It contians アオウミガメ.  This was not found in our Core10k deck. (This is 
because it is the name of a specific type of sea turtle).  You can then add 
this word to Anki manually.


INSTALLATION
============

This can be installed by either copying the script to somewhere on your path 
directly, or using python's setuptools.

Here is how to install using Python's setuptools:

$ cd anki-high-priority/
$ ls
README  scripts  setup.cfg  setup.py
$ python2 ./setup.py install --prefix=/some/path/
....
$

The script will be installed to /some/path/bin/anki-high-priority.


RC FILE
=======

anki-high-priority uses a config file in your HOME directory to know what decks 
to look in, and what field to search for the words in.  When running for the 
first time, anki-high-priority will create the rc file if it does not exist.  
Please follow the instructions in the rc file to configure it for your decks.
